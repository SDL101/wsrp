This document is the full guide to setup, use and explanation of this project. The intended audience is anyone who wishes to use and explore the Website Security Research Project. 

## Introduction

This is an application that is meant to explore common security vulnerabilities in web applications. Everything to launch a full-stack web application is included in this repository, including set up instructions and details on the various vulnerabilities explored. 

The application itself is a lightweight banking application, in which a user can log in as a customer or an employee, access account details and view transactions. 

The database is a MySQL relational database. The server is a Python Flask application, and the front end uses the Vue.js framework. 

> [!WARNING]
> Beacuse of the security vulnerabilities intentionally included in this application, we advise anyone trying it out to do so inside of a virtual machine. We have chosen VirtualBox running an instance of Ubuntu 22.04 as our virtual environment, which is covered in [Setup Instructions](#setup-instructions)
